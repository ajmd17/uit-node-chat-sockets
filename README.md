# UIT Exercise (Chat App)

Today we're going to be working with EJS and sockets to make a very simple chat server!  Given the following skeleton, you'll be required to do the following:

  - Use the existing EJS file (index.ejs) to render the root path (route). Add in at least one dynamic variable of your own (you don't have to change it, I just want to see it working)
  - Socket.io is already installed and ready to accept connections. Update the sockets in both the front and back end to receive messages, send messages, and enter a username.  **Pro Tip:** you should probably start with the username :).
  - Configure your socket app to contain a list of usernames. **Pro Tip:** If you are having trouble with this, remember to consult the socket.io video that was watched in class.
